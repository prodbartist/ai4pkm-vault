## Installation

### For Claude Code

1. Clone this repository or copy the skill folders:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/jykim/claude-obsidian-skills.git
```

2. Copy skills to your Claude Code skills directory:
```bash
cp -r claude-obsidian-skills/*-* ~/.claude/skills/
```

3. Claude Code will automatically detect and use the skills.

### For Other AI Assistants

Copy the `SKILL.md` file from the desired skill folder to your assistant's skill directory. Each skill is self-contained and documented within its SKILL.md file.

### Advanced: Git Submodule Integration

For vault maintainers who want to keep skills in sync with this repository while avoiding duplication:

1. Add as a submodule to your vault:
```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/jykim/claude-obsidian-skills.git path/to/skills/public-skills
```

2. Create symlinks for backward compatibility:
```bash
cd path/to/skills
ln -s public-skills/obsidian-canvas obsidian-canvas
ln -s public-skills/obsidian-links obsidian-links
ln -s public-skills/obsidian-yaml-frontmatter obsidian-yaml-frontmatter
ln -s public-skills/obsidian-markdown-structure obsidian-markdown-structure
ln -s public-skills/obsidian-mermaid obsidian-mermaid
ln -s public-skills/markdown-slides markdown-slides
ln -s public-skills/markdown-video markdown-video
ln -s public-skills/interactive-writing-assistant interactive-writing-assistant
ln -s public-skills/video-cleaning video-cleaning
```

3. Update skills when new versions are released:
```bash
git submodule update --remote
```

**Benefits:**
- Single source of truth - edit in one place
- Version control - pin to specific commits if needed
- Easy updates via git submodule commands

**Note:** When cloning a vault with submodules, use `--recursive`:
```bash
git clone --recursive your-vault-repo
```
