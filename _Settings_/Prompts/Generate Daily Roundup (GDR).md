   - Fill note sections appropriately

2. COMPREHENSIVE SOURCE INTEGRATION
   - Count available sources first
   - Integrate Apple Notes with summaries
   - Review ALL available clippings for date
   - Dedup sources (processed sources have priority)
   - Generate source coverage report

3. QUOTE MINING & TOPIC LINKING
   - Extract 3-5 memorable quotes preserving voice
   - Search existing Topics directory before linking
   - Validate all topic links point to existing files
   - Add "Topics to Create" list if needed

4. JOURNAL ENHANCEMENT

   - Add roundup link to links property
   - Ensure bidirectional linking is complete
```

## Caveats
### Folder Exclusion
- `_` 접두사 폴더 무시 (`_Settings_/`, `_UserTest_/` 등) — 시스템/테스트 파일이므로 소스로 포함하지 않음

### Source Coverage Requirements
⚠️ **CRITICAL**: Target 80%+ coverage of available sources

### Quote Mining & Topic Linking
- Extract 3-5 memorable quotes (format per `obsidian-markdown-structure` skill)
- Validate ALL topic links (use `obsidian-links` skill)
- Link to established topics: PKM.md, AI Tools.md, Golf.md, Life Philosophy.md

### Journal Enhancement Rules
- Be brief but comprehensive
- Don't touch existing contents
- Each content should have link(s) to source note
- Ensure bidirectional linking is complete
